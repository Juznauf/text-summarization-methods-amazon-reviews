       "'The bouquet is evocative and tended to linger in the air yet was in no way overpowering. A fine impression remains when the cup is set down and the intake of breath recharges the sensation. Some brews become distinctly unpleasant when the leaves are introduced to certain mineral-rich well water or treated city water. However, for a proper moment of relaxation-- or an attempt to induce one in the midst of chaos. This hot sauce is delicious. I put it on chinese food, mexican food, macaroni & cheese, everything. If youre looking for something really tasty and with a kick (and youre bored of Tabasco, Texas Pete, and all those) then you should try some of this stuff. I was so excited to try a sweet hot sauce, my hubby and I are obsessed with buying new hot sauces, its actually the first thing we look to purchase when we are traveling. YAHOO. This is some of the finest hot sauce Ive had. I highly reccomend putting it on pizza, breakfast burritos, steaks, chicken, everything. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed. All hot sauces are not created equal. It is light and carries a lot of punch. If you are looking for a new twist this is it. The Sour Apple is probably the one that is least like its name but is tasty nonetheless. Although they have not tasted them yet, the presentation ALONEs SIMPLY MARVELOUS. The speed in which my order was expedited was amazing. I would buy this product again, especially since its a lot cheaper than the porcinis in my local grocery. It takes about 20 minutes to rehydrate. For those of us who cant stroll down to the local store and buy fresh ones (and I expect there are many of you out there), I think these are a good way to go. Thanks for the service. I use Green Fit every morning as a great \"Boost\" to get my busy day started on the right track. I knew I would need vitamins and at least one overall healthy drink each morning. out to the beach I go. No worrys. I cant believe something like this hasnt been on the market until now. I downed one of these babies before an intense workout and another one after. wow. Love this stuff. And the thought of having enough protien and fiber at the same time is way better than eating a fried egg sandwich. For those who like flavored teas, this is a dont-miss. I dont want to go through a complicated process with alot of noise or big expense. I microwave milk and pour the \"espresso\" in. Order with confidence in a good product. havent tried the free sample coffee pod or k-cup that came with it yet, but i tried a bag of tea that i had in my pantry, and it came out amazing. will try the k-cup in the morning, but i expect the same results. When it arrived, I was amazed at how easy it is to use and more importantly how great the coffee tastes. Love it. I love the fact that it includes an adapter for my own coffee, because I like to use my own freshly ground beans from a local coffee bean roaster. ( Did I mention coffee snob?)Having a way to make an easy,fast and excellent cup of coffee makes getting up in the morning something to really look forward to. I ordered this after a friend told me about all the great features & benefits and was so surprised at how great the coffee tasted, ease of use and the value added with all the additional parts. If you dont have a Keurig machine and want a inexpensive way to use K-Cups then you may be satisfied. Also, it helps me stretch my food dollars by turning a few leftovers into a brand new, tasty meal. I ate the whole bag. Wow. I hide mine from my friends and I do not share. \"  The humility. I try as many hot sauces as I can. I put hot sauce on nearly everything. I highly recommend giving this sauce a try. This hot sauce is fantastic. Give it a try. Love this Hot Sauce. Helps keeps them fresh'"
